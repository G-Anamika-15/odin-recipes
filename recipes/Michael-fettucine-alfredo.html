        <h3>Ingredients you'll need to recreate this iconic dish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
            <li>12 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>3 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
            <li>3 Â½ cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Let's get to making this dish!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to the water to season the pasta. Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Saute the garlic and butter together until softened -- about 1 to 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth</li>
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
            <li>Serve while hot to Michael Scott just before he is going for his 5K run!</li>
